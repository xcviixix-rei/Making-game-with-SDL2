Repository for updating my game
Game name: Ani - Combat
Game description : If you know about the game "Bleach vs Naruto", my game has exactly the same way to play with that game! In both these games, you use the keys w a s d to move your character and other keys to attack or perform special skills. The different features here are you don not have to fight with a character bot or something but so many monsters. Game will end with your victory when you clear or the monsters in time. If you cannot finish before running out of time or get killed by the monsters, you lose.
